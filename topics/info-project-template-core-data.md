## Info: Project Template for Core Data projects

This document briefly introduces you to the new project template for projects that use the Core Data storage technology. It complements the in-class coverage from Monday November 12. 

The purpose of this document is to provide you with information. A separate "how to" document will show you how to use it for a new project. 

<br>

### Get the template

In the course's GitHub repository, in the [Templates_and_solutions](https://github.com/dps923/fall2018/tree/master/Templates_and_solutions) folder, 
you will see a project named **TemplateCDv1**.

Make a copy of that, and you will have all you need to start working on a new project.

> How do I make a copy?  
> The Readme.txt file in the CodeDataModel project helps you do this.

### What is the design of the template

We have prepared a diagram that illustrates the design of the template. Click to open it full-size in its own tab/window:
