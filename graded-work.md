## Graded work

This page has details about the graded work in DPS923 and MAP523, for the current academic term.

<br>

### Tests

We have planned approximately four (4) tests during the term.

The duration of each test will be about 40 to 60 minutes, and will be worth between 10% and 14% of your final course grade. All tests will be hand-written, and will happen sometime during the Friday class timeslot. The total value of all tests will be 50%.

Recognizing that it’s possible to have an "off day", the final grade calculation will examine the results of all four tests, and discount the value of the lowest-graded test to 50%.

Alternatively, if you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. However, absence due to illness happens occasionally. As a result, there will be a policy and procedure which could possibly excuse the test.

### Assignments

We have planned approximately four (4) assignments during the term.

The first three assignments are worth 8%, 10%, and 14%. One of these three assignments can be up to three days late, without penalty. 

> On Blackboard, the upload link for each assignment disappears after its due date and time. If you are submitting a late assignment:  
> 1. Upload it to the link for the *next* assignment  
> 2. Notify me by email that you have done this

The final assignment is worth 18%, and must be submitted by the due date and time, otherwise its grade is zero, and there will not be an opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.

The total value of all assignments will be 50%.

### Frequently-asked questions

The following are frequently-asked questions about course policies and grading. 

<br>

**Make-up (replacement) tests? No.**

We don't do make-up or replacement tests, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* Tests are designed, in part, to encourage you to prepare *before* you walk into the room. Doing a test after the class has happened is unacceptable and disrespects your classmates.

* There will be a policy to handle legitimate illness incidents, so missing a test does not affect your final grade.

* Test answers may be discussed during class, so doing a test after class is pointless.

Therefore, no make-up or replacement tests. 

<br>

**Due date extensions? No.**

As noted above, during the term, one (1) *late* Assignment 1, or 2, or 3 will be accepted within three (3) days of its due date without penalty. 

However, as a general rule, we don't do due date extensions for assignments, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* A due date extension is *not necessary* in this course, because each assignment is designed so that it can comfortably and successfully completed - by *all* students - before its due date and time.

* It causes problems for other work that follows an assignment, because it leaves less time to complete the next piece of work.

* It takes your attention away from new topics in this course. You’re less receptive, or will ignore, new topics that follow those that are practiced on the assignment.

* A due date extension is disrespectful to other students in the course, because it tells them that the work they did to meet the due date doesn’t have value.

* Finally, a due date extension is disrespectful to other professors and their courses, because it takes your attention away from their coursework while you are working on late work in another course.

Therefore, no due date extensions.
