### Get help with course work

I am obviously available during our course time slots on Wednesday and Friday.

During the Wednesday class, I will have limited free time.

During the Friday class, I will have substantial free time. Fridays will be the best day to get one-on-one help from me.

I plan to have drop-in help time on Wednesdays and Fridays in the period just before our classes.

While I will be somewhat available by email at other times, I will prefer to be available for help during the days and times discussed above. I will *not* commit to being available 24Ã—7.

This may become important to you if you are facing a deadline for the assignment submission, and you discover that you want my help on a day on which I am not available. I will almost certainly not be available. Therefore, you will be on your own, but you still must practice academic honesty. If you anticipate that this practice will be a problem for you, then set your own personal assignment due date deadline to better match my availability.
