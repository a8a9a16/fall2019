There are also three Mac labs, S2112, S2113, and S2046. 

The versions of macOS, Xcode, and Swift are a bit newer in our School of ICT Mac lab in DB3078. Therefore, we *strongly recommend* that you configure your iOS projects to target iOS version 11.0 or 10.x. That way, you can work on your project on any of the campus Macs. 

> Your professor will show you how to target an iOS version.

#### A few thoughts about the required textbook

This course has a required textbook. Our pathway through the course will closely track the textbook chapter sequence. Your professor will contribute little or no original conetnt. Don't want to buy the book? You probably won't pass the course. Want to steal the book (i.e. not pay the publisher)? Well, it's your life, morals, and ethics, but keep in mind that the authors are simply asking to be paid for their efforts. Will you ever want to get paid when you graduate and get into the workforce? Yup, you will, so think of this before you steal. Also, think about how often you must buy a textbook for a course - not too often, so this is not a hardship.
