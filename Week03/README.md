### Introduction

There are several code examples this week. While GitHub displays the folder names in alphabetic order, your professor recommends that you go through the examples in the sequence shown below. 

The code example naming scheme includes the week number and a little info about the topic coverage. For example:
* W01a1Label = week 1, app 1, label 
* W01a2BtnLabel = week 1, app 2, button and label
* etc.

###  W03a1Alerts

Shows how to create, configure, and use an alert and an action sheet.  

<br>

###  W03a2Shapes1 - Shapes app 1

The app enables the user to add and remove "shapes" to-from the view.  
Each "shape" is a programmatically-created UIView object.  

The template-provided view controller was renamed (via the refactor task) to "Shapes".  
A new Cocoa Touch Class named "Shape" was added; it is based on UIView.  

<br>

###  W03a3Shapes2 - Shapes app 2

Based on app 1.  
The app adds the ability to drag shapes around the view.

<br>

###  W03a4Shapes3 - Shapes app 3

Based on app 2.  

The app adds the ability to work with single and double taps.  
A single tap brings the shape to the foreground (the top of the view hierarchy).  
A double tap (with one finger) grows the shape by 15%.  
A two-finger tap shrinks the shape by 15%.

<br>

###  W03a5Shapes4 - Shapes app 4

This is mostly based on app 3.

The app uses images instead of drawn shapes.  
(coming soon) Includes pinch and zoom.  
(coming soon) Includes rotate.
