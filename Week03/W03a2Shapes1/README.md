###  Shapes app 1

It is based on the single view app template.

The app enables the user to add and remove "shapes" to the view.

Each "shape" is a programmatically-created UIView object.

The template-provided view controller was renamed (via the refactor task) to "Shapes".

A new Cocoa Touch Class named "Shape" was added; it is based on UIView.
