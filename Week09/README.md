### W09a1LoadV1

Based on the `TemplateCDv1` project template. 

This app has a navigation interface.  
The initial scene is managed by a standard view controller.    
It enables the user to create - *programmatically* - some new objects in the store.  
Also enables navigation to a list of objects, and selection of one of those navigates to a scene with some of the object's contents showing on a standard scene.
