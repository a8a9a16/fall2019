### Introduction

There are several code examples this week. While GitHub displays the folder names in alphabetic order, your professor recommends that you go through the examples in the sequence shown below. 

The code example naming scheme includes the week number and a little info about the topic coverage. For example:
* W01a1Label = week 1, app 1, label 
* W01a2BtnLabel = week 1, app 2, button and label
* etc.
