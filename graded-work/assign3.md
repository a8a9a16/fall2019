Assignment 3 builds upon the multi-view navigation-style app idea, by adding coverage of recently-covered topics. 

Read/skim all of this document before you begin work.

While you are doing the work, if a *specific task* is not clear, or it seems to require an unreasonable amount of time to complete, contact your professor.

### Overview and purpose

We need an app that will (more to come... and edit the list of text file submissions)

<br>

### Getting started

<br>

### Doing the work (...)

Again, as noted above, read/skim the rest of this document before you begin work. That way you know what's coming.

### Testing your work

Test your work by running it on the simulator. Do this frequently and incrementally, after making any substantial changes. 

Your professor plans to introduce you to the Xcode debugger soon, and that tool may help you troubleshoot problems. 

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard “SafeAssign” tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

> From the Blackboard web site:  
> SafeAssign compares submitted assignments against a set of academic papers to identify areas of overlap between the submitted assignment and existing works.

<br>

### Submitting your work

Follow these instructions to submit your work, before the due date and time:  

1. Locate your projectfolder in Finder (and we suggest that you make a copy of it for yourself).

2. In that folder, add a new folder named "MyCode".

3. Copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**Main.storyboard**  
**( more to come )**  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. Right-click the folder, and choose **Compress “xxxxxxxx”**, which creates a zip file.  

5. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there.
