## DPS923 and MAP523 Assignment 3

Assignment 3 enables you to show how to use the network in an iOS app. 

<mark>It's likely that DPS923 students will do one of the tasks a bit differently, and will have one more task to complete. To be finalized.</mark>

Read/skim all of this document before you begin work.

While you are doing the work, if a *specific task* is not clear, or it seems to require an unreasonable amount of time to complete, contact your professor. 

<br>

### Due Date

Sunday, November 3, 2019, at 11:00pm ET  
Grade value: 14% of your final course grade

> Notice the due date change, from Friday to Sunday.  
> This is intended to be helpful by taking a bit of pressure off the Friday experience.  
> If you don't need the weekend, you can still submit early.  

*If you wish to submit the assignment before the due date and time, you can do that.*

<br>

### Overview and purpose

Here are the point-form specifications (which will be expanded on in the sections that follow). 

It's a multi-scene app:
* TBA (more to come)

Also, the app: 
* Has a navigation interface
* And a data model, implemented using best practices 
  * On-device storage of the data 
* And is deployed to an iOS device 

<br>

### Getting started, web API

(yes, you will create and deploy a web API)  
(it will be used by your iOS app) 

<br>

### Getting started, iOS app

Create a new iOS app, using the Single View Application template. The name of the app should be "**TBA**".  

Follow best practices about project creation. Ask if you are unsure. 

<br>

### Doing the work

Again, as noted above, read/skim the rest of this document before you begin work. That way you know what's coming. 

Follow best practices and recommended guidance in all parts of your work. 

Test your work incrementally. Do one small task, and then test it to ensure that it works, before continuing. 

<br>

#### Sketch the app's scenes 

Before completing this task, make sure that you read/skim the rest of this document - that way you will know what to include in the sketch. 

As you learned in [Week 4](https://dps923.ca/notes/week04#designing-and-implementing-a-substantial-multi-scene-app), and as you have seen demonstrated by the professor in-class a number of times, create a sketch of the app's design. Include the scenes that you expect to have, both storyboard-based and code-created. Also include rectangles that aren't scenes, for example, the app delegate etc. 

After sketching it out, save it (by scanning it or taking a photo of it). You will submit this sketch. Then, as you work on the assignment, you can modify or fix the sketch if you wish. 

> Don't do this task at the end of your work on the assignment.  
> The professor wants to see the sketch before you begin.  
> It will help him understand your thought process, and your current level of understanding. 

<br>

#### Getting started

<mark>More to come.</mark>

<br>

#### Data model 

TBA

<br>

### Testing your work

Test your work by running it on the simulator. Do this frequently and incrementally, after making any substantial changes. And, use the Xcode debugger to help. 

When the app is complete, create three screen captures. Here's what each scene will show:
1. TBA

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard "SafeAssign" tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

> From the Blackboard web site:  
> SafeAssign compares submitted assignments against a set of academic papers to identify areas of overlap between the submitted assignment and existing works.

<br>

### Submitting your work

<mark>To be finalized</mark>

Follow these instructions to submit your work, before the due date and time:  

1. Locate your project folder in Finder (and we suggest that you make a copy for yourself).

2. At the same level, create a new folder named "MyCode".

3. From the TBA folder(s), copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**TBA.swift**  
**DataModelClasses.swift**  
**DataModelManager.swift**  
**Main.storyboard**  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. From wherever, copy the sketch you made of the app's scenes into the MyCode folder. Its name can be something like "SketchAppUI". 

5. From wherever, copy the three screen captures into the MyCode folder. Rename them to "TBA" (jpg or png, whatever), "TBA", and "TBA". 

6. Select the top-level folders:  
TBA  
MyCode  
Right-click, and choose **Compress 2 Items**, which creates a zip file (make sure the zip file is fairly small, around 2MB or less).  

7. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there.
