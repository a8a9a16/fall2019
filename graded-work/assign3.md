## DPS923 and MAP523 Assignment 3

Assignment 3 builds upon the multi-view navigation-style app idea, by adding coverage of recently-covered topics. 

Read/skim all of this document before you begin work.

While you are doing the work, if a *specific task* is not clear, or it seems to require an unreasonable amount of time to complete, contact your professor.

### Due Date

Wednesday, November 7, 2018, at 11:00pm ET  
Grade value: 10% of your final course grade

*If you wish to submit the assignment before the due date and time, you can do that.*

### Overview and purpose

We need an app that will work with data about Canada's provinces and cities. 

The app's first scene is a list of provinces. The data model manager's initializer code creates two provinces.

<br>

Tapping on the `+` "add" (upper-right) button will modally present an "Add Province" scene.

<br>

Back on the province list, tapping a province's &#9432; detail accessory shows more detail.

<br>

Alternatively, tapping elsewhere on the row will show the next scene, which is a list of cities in the tapped/selected province.

<br>

There is a similar workflow for cities (in a province). 

<br>

### Getting started

(more to come)

<br>

### Doing the work (...)

Again, as noted above, read/skim the rest of this document before you begin work. That way you know what's coming. 

<br>

#### TBA

(more to come)

<br>

### Testing your work

Test your work by running it on the simulator. Do this frequently and incrementally, after making any substantial changes. 

Your professor plans to introduce you to the Xcode debugger soon, and that tool may help you troubleshoot problems. 

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard “SafeAssign” tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

> From the Blackboard web site:  
> SafeAssign compares submitted assignments against a set of academic papers to identify areas of overlap between the submitted assignment and existing works.

<br>

### Submitting your work

Follow these instructions to submit your work, before the due date and time:  

1. Locate your projectfolder in Finder (and we suggest that you make a copy of it for yourself).

2. In that folder, add a new folder named "MyCode".

3. Copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**Main.storyboard**  
**( more to come )**  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. Right-click the folder, and choose **Compress “xxxxxxxx”**, which creates a zip file.  

5. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there.
