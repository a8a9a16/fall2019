#### Sketch the app's scenes 

Before completing this task, make sure that you read/skim the rest of this document - that way you will know what to include in the sketch. 

As you learned in [Week 4](https://dps923.ca/notes/week04#designing-and-implementing-a-substantial-multi-scene-app), and as you have seen demonstrated by the professor in-class a number of times, create a sketch of the app's design. Include the scenes that you expect to have, both storyboard-based and code-created. Also include rectangles that aren't scenes, for example, the app delegate etc. 

After sketching it out, save it (by scanning it or taking a photo of it). You will submit this sketch. Then, as you work on the assignment, you can modify or fix the sketch if you wish. 

> Don't do this task at the end of your work on the assignment.  
> The professor wants to see the sketch before you begin.  
> It will help him understand your thought process, and your current level of understanding.
