### Overview and purpose

We need an app that will enable you to capture and store information about the food you eat during the day. 

It is important for everyone to have good nutrition habits. Diet and nutrition issues are too easy for people to ignore and dismiss as unimportant, but good food brings health, both in body and in mind. Modern society and culture have increased interest in food and health, so an app like this could be useful.

In general, the app features include:
* Can capture info about food items consumed
* The food item name or identification can be entered by you, or provided by a public web service 
* Your additional notes/text can be added 
* The new item will have its location info stored (where, when, and so on) 
* Optionally, a photo of the food/meal can be taken 

Here are some sample screen capture images...

The "first launch" scene; as an empty list, and with some items:

<img class="border1" src="images/a4-first-launch.png" alt="List, empty"><img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-list-3-items.png" alt="List, with items">

Add item scenes:

<img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-first-time-permission.png" alt="Location permission"><img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-scene.png" alt="Input fields">

Add a photo scenes:

<img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-scene-photo.png" alt="Get/take photo"><img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-scene-before-save.png" alt="New item, ready to save">

Search for an item, setup, and list of possibles:

<img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-search-step1.png" alt="Enter search terms"><img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-search-step2-list.png" alt="List of possibilities">

After selecting an item on the list, before saving, and then the result after configuring a photo:

<img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-add-search-step3-before-save.png" alt="Before save"><img class="border1" src="images/a4-item-info-scene.png" alt="Item info scene">

> DPS923 students will have a few additional specifications.

### DPS923 additional functionality

DPS923 students must implement the following additional functionality:
* TBA

### Testing your work

Test your work by running it on the simulator. Do this frequently and incrementally, after making any substantial changes. And, use the Xcode debugger to help. 

When the app is complete, create screen captures. Here's what each scene will show:
1. TBA

### Reminder about academic honesty

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard "SafeAssign" tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

> From the Blackboard web site:  
> SafeAssign compares submitted assignments against a set of academic papers to identify areas of overlap between the submitted assignment and existing works.

<br>

### Submitting your work

Follow these instructions to submit your work, before the due date and time:  

1. Locate your project folder in Finder (and we suggest that you make a copy for yourself).

2. At the same level, create a new folder named "MyCode".

3. From the project folder(s), copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**TBA.swift**  
**DataModelClasses.swift**  
**DataModelManager.swift**  
**Main.storyboard**  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. From wherever, copy the screen captures into the MyCode folder. Rename them to (TBA). 

5. Select the top-level folders:  
(project)  
MyCode  
Right-click, and choose **Compress 2 Items**, which creates a zip file (make sure the zip file is fairly small, around 2MB or less).  

6. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there.
