### Overview and purpose

We need an app that will enable you to capture and store information about the food you eat during the day. 

Important for everyone to have good nutrition  
Easy for young people to ignore and dismiss as unimportant  
Society and culture have increased interest in food and health  
(etc.)

Features:
* Capture info about food...
* Name or identification provided by a public web service 
* Your additional notes and text 
* Location info (where, when, and so on) 
* Optionally, a photo of the food/meal

### Getting started

Use the TemplateCDv1 as a base.  
Copy-paste (duplicate Command+D in the file system).  
Then rename project and scheme.  

<br>

### Doing the work, data model classes

Again, as noted above, read/skim the rest of this document before you begin work. That way you know what's coming.

### Add controller

Reverse geocoding done after a location is found  
`placemarks` is an array of CLPlacemark  


<br>

### Testing your work

Test your work by running it on the simulator. Do this frequently and incrementally, after making any substantial changes. Use the debug tool when it's useful to do so.

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard “SafeAssign” tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

> From the Blackboard web site:  
> SafeAssign compares submitted assignments against a set of academic papers to identify areas of overlap between the submitted assignment and existing works.

<br>

### Submitting your work

Follow these instructions to submit your work, before the due date and time:  

1. Locate your project folder in Finder (and we suggest that you make a copy of it for yourself).

2. In that folder, add a new folder named "MyCode".

3. Copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**Main.storyboard**  
**DataModelClasses.swift**  
**DataModelManager.swift**  
<mark>( more to come )</mark>  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. Right-click the folder, and choose **Compress “xxxxxxxx”**, which creates a zip file.  

5. Login to Blackboard/My.Seneca, and in this course's Assignments area, look for the upload link, and submit your work there.
