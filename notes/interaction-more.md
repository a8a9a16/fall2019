## Interaction in a substantial app

A "substantial" app is one that has multiple scenes, a navigation interface, and many interaction features (list data, add and/or modify data, etc.). 

Obviously, it is possible to have apps that do vastly different things and offer a varied user experience. Despite this flexibility, the navigation patterns and the interaction features are well-understood, with standard and consistent implementation techniques.

This document covers these patterns and features.
