## DPS923 MAP523 Week 9 Notes

More work with Core Data this week and next. 

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics  
6:50pm - done  

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Plan for this week:
* What problem are we trying to solve?
* Key ideas for those new to Core Data 
* Project template for a Core Data enabled app 

We will cover these - discuss, show-and-tell, diagram, etc. - in the Wednesday class. While some brief notes are included below, be prepared to [take your own notes](/standards#taking-notes-in-class).
