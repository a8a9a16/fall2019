#### Core Data introduction

The plist file type is good for simple data. However, it is not suitable for a typical app's data. iOS apps use *Core Data*. 

As noted above, Core Data is an object design, management, and persistence framework:
* We design objects by using classes, and a design tool 
* The framework has objects that enable the full range of data service operations (e.g. fetch, add, and so on), and work nicely with controllers 
* And finally, it takes care of persisting (saving, storing) the app's data
