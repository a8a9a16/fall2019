## DPS923 MAP523 Week 9 Notes

More work with Core Data this week and next. 

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics  
6:50pm - done  

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Plan for this week:
* Another project template for a Core Data enabled app 
* Fetch requests explained
* Fetched results controller introduction

We will cover these - discuss, show-and-tell, diagram, etc. - in the Wednesday class. While some brief notes are included below, be prepared to [take your own notes](/standards#taking-notes-in-class). 

<br>

### Tentative topic plan 

Learn via the code examples.

A [version 2](https://github.com/dps923/fall2019/tree/master/Templates_and_solutions) of the project template. 

[Fetch request essentials](core-data-fetchrequest-essentials).

(coming soon...) Fetched results controller essentials. 

[Syntax comparisons among data store technologies](core-data-syntax-compare).

[Core Data essentials summary](core-data-essentials). 

(more to come)

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* W09a1LoadV1
* TemplateCDv2 (in the templates and solutions folder)

### Friday plan

Your goal today is to create an app that uses a Core Data store. It will display data based on something that Mockaroo can easily generate. Here's what to do:

1. Use `TemplateCDv2` to create an app. Do the "rename" tasks to a project name that makes sense. 

2. Visit [mockaroo.com](https://mockaroo.com). Generate 150 rows of JSON data. Configure the fields so that you have at least one field that gets values that repeat somewhat (e.g. states, provinces, car makes, etc. - look around; don't be lazy). 

3. Add that JSON file to your project.  

4. Use the code example to learn how to load the JSON data into a Core Data store. 

5. Change the "list" table view controller to display the data. 

In #5 above, we suggest that you use a simpler *fetch request* object first, to fetch the data. 

Then, adapt the code, changing it to use a *fetched results controller* object. Obviously, the cell rendering code will have to change a bit.
