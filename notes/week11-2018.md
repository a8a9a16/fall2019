## DPS923 MAP523 Week 11 Notes

New this week is coverage on using the network and internet (specifically a web service), and using the device's camera. We also revisit the location services topic.  

<br>

### Monday plan

Professor-led discussion and demonstration of the topics named above. 

The professor may also guide you through the topic hightlights in the textbook. 

Chapter coverage includes parts of 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 34, 35, and 36.

#### Using the device's camera

In class, your professor will show how to use the device's camera and/or photo library, and discuss a number of topic features and considerations.  

This topic is supported by textbook coverage in Chapter 30.

Assignment 4 also provides some support, in its section titled "[Add camera and photo handling](https://dps923.ca/graded-work/assign4#add-camera-and-photo-handling)". 

Finally, a helpful code example named "egCamera" is posted in the course's code repository, in the [Week 11 folder](https://github.com/dps923/fall2018/tree/master/Week11).

#### Using the network and internet

In class, your professor will show how to interact with a web API, and discuss a number of topic features and considerations. 

This topic is supported by textbook coverage in Chapters 34, 35, and 36. 

Assignment 4 also provides considerable support, starting in the section titled "[Get the network involved](https://dps923.ca/graded-work/assign4#get-the-network-involved)". 

Finally, a helpful code example named "egWebApiGet" is posted in the course's code repository, in the [Week 11 folder](https://github.com/dps923/fall2018/tree/master/Week11). 

To summarize the key/important need-to-know facts about using the network, we offer the following:
* It is very important to study and know the web API's features (available resources, interaction patterns, and response structures). 
* We must design structs that match the type of data in the responses (and in the requests too, when necessary). 
* Methods that do the data service operations are (as is typical now) written and stored in a manager (extension). 
* To support a number of objectives, and to make the process better, we work with a provided `WebApiRequest` class.
