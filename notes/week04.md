## DPS923 MAP523 Week 4 Notes

This week, we begin to learn how to design and create a substantial app with many features, now that you have some good foundation skills and techniques. 

If your Mac automatically updated Xcode to version 11, and you want to continue to use the previous version 10, [this document can help](xcode-previous-version).

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Tentative plan for this week:
