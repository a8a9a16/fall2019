## DPS923 MAP523 Week 10 Notes

The theme for this week is to learn more about building apps that use Core Data. 

<br>

### Monday plan

The professor may also guide you through the topic hightlights in the textbook. 

Chapter 28, 29, 30

> Note - Test 3 is on Wednesday 

<br>

#### Core Data project template

Your professor has created a template that can be used to create an app that uses Core Data. We will study and use it today.

( more to come )

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Test 3 is today, at the beginning of the timeslot.

It will cover past content, with these themes:
* Core Data technology 
* New project template
* Building an app with the new project template
* Maybe a bit of location services (chapters 22 and 23)

> Nothing on the maps and images topics will be tested.

At the beginning of the timeslot, we can use up to a half-hour to answer student questions and/or to review contet. The test will begin no later than 3:50pm, and its duration will be about 50 minutes. It is worth 13%, which means that you will answer any questions worth a total of 13 marks. Most questions are worth one mark, and some are worth more.

#### Preparing for the test 

You can rely on your hand-written notes and in-person learning from the past two Monday classes (Monday November 12, and Monday November 5). In those, you learned much about the design and engineering of an iOS app, and how to use patterns and best practices to get results. 

Update your understanding of Core Data, using the relevant textbook chapters (27 and 28). Go through the [summary information](/topics/info-core-data-intro) to learn more and to review. 

Next, get the new project template. In the course's GitHub repository, in the [Templates_and_solutions](https://github.com/dps923/fall2018/tree/master/Templates_and_solutions) folder, 
you will see a project named **TemplateCDv1**. 

The template's design and code is explained in this document:

[Info: Project Template for Core Data projects](/topics/info-project-template-core-data)

The intention is for you to make a *copy* of that project, and then follow its "Readme.txt" instructions to rename it to match your project's needs. Study its design and operation, and do some additional programming yourself. 

Next, get the code example that's in the Week 10 folder of the repository. Look for a project named **CanadaTest**. It is essentially a Core Data version of the "Canada" (provinces and cities) programming assignment. Study all parts of that app. Use it, add data, notice its features and functionality. 

On the test, be prepared to answer questions about the design of an app as illustrated by the object diagram that was distributed in class on Monday November 12. 

Be prepared to name and/or define, and then explain some of the individual or discrete programmed components in an app. You should be comfortable with both the template-provided parts as well as some framework-provided parts. 

And, be prepared to explain or interpret some small-size code snippets. We may also ask for code or pseudocode (algorithm) additions to enhance or complete a task.
