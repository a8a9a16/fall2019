## Xcode previous version

Apple released the new versions of macOS and Xcode near the end of September. 

If your Mac has the Software Update feature configured to "Automatically keep my Mac up to date", and in the advanced settings, "Install app updates from the App Store", then you may have noticed that your Mac now has the new version of Xcode. 

If you want to continue to use the previous version of Xcode for the duration of this DPS923/MAP523 course, this document will help. 

> This note was most recently updated in September 2019.  
> Xcode version 11 was released in that month.  
> This document was updated by assuming and using Xcode version 10 as the "previous version".

### Overview, how to

There are several steps:
1. Login to the Apple Developer web site 
2. Download Xcode 
3. Unzip the download package
4. Rename the app
5. Move the app to the Applications folder

<br>

#### Login to the Apple Developer web site 

Login to the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com) web site, using your Apple ID. 

<br>

#### Download Xcode 

Locate the software downloads link, and follow it. The "downloads" landing page will likely be promoting something that we're not really interested in. 

Near the right, there is a [More](https://developer.apple.com) link. Follow it. 

In the left-side "Search Downloads" field, enter the text `xcode 10` and press return. The results list will show it near the top. Click the `+` plus sign to reveal the download link, then do that. 

It's a big download, so ensure that you have a good Internet connection until the download completes. 

<br>

#### Unzip the download package

On your Mac, using Finder, open the downloaded file, which will unzip the package, yielding an app named "Xcode.app". 

<br>

#### Rename the app

We suggest that you rename this app so that it includes the version number. For example, `Xcode10`. 

<br>

#### Move the app to the Applications folder

Move this app from the downloads folder to the Applications folder. (Open another Finder tab or window, and press Command+Shift+A to quickly open the Applications folder.)

Start/run this app for the first time. It will likely prompt you to add or install tools or features; yes, do that.
