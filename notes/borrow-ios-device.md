## Borrow an iOS device

The College has a limited number of iOS devices (mostly iPhone 6S and iPad mini 4).  

Students in the course can borrow one of these devices for use during the course. 

( more to come )

> The iPhones are unlocked, and therefore will work on the cellular network if the student wishes to purchase a "pay as you go" SIM and package. The College will not pay for your cellular service!
