## Borrow an iOS device

The College has a limited number of iOS devices (mostly iPhone 6S and iPad mini 4).  

Students in the course can borrow one of these devices for use during the course. There is no borrowing cost. It must be returned at the end of the course in good working order. A simple paper-based agreement must be signed as part of the borrowing process (in it, you agree to these conditions). 

If a student wants to borrow a device, send email to the professor. 

> The iPhones are unlocked, and therefore will work on the cellular network if the student wishes to purchase a "pay as you go" SIM and package. The College will not pay for your cellular service!
