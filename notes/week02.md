## DPS923 MAP523 Week 2 Notes

The theme for this week is to get comfortable with the process of creating a simple iOS app. 

For the next several weeks, we have our classroom session on Monday, and our computer-lab session on Wednesday. 

<br>

### Monday plan

The professor will guide you through the topics in the textbook. 

Chapter 1: Introduction  
Chapter 2: The One-Button App  
Chapter 3: Slider and Labels

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Work on Assignment 1. The professor will help you get started, to ensure that you can make progress. 

Today, we introduce a topic - outlets - that are fully covered next week. There are a couple of reasons for today's introduction of *outlets*:
1. It shows you a way to enable your *code* to make changes in the *view*
2. It enables you to learn a new Xcode feature, the "Assistant Editor" 

This week, you learned something about *actions*, which enable user interactions on a *view* to call a function in your *code*. An *outlet* works in the other direction. 

When covering *actions*, you learned the Xcode technique to make a connection from the *view* to some of your *code*. Today, when introducing *outlets*, you can learn another Xcode technique to combine the connection-making with the code-writing, by using the *Assistant Editor*. 

To effectively use the Assistant Editor, do the following:
1. In Xcode, show the storyboard. 
2. Above the view, in the tray strip, select/highlight the left-most "view controller" icon. 
3. Open the Assistant Editor, using the top-right button or the keyboard shortcut.
4. If you need more room left-and-right, hide the navigation panel, and the utilities panel. (And maybe the storyboard list of objects.)
