## DPS923 MAP523 Week 2 Notes

The theme for this week is to learn and experience a number of user interaction capabilities and techniques. Along the way, you will work with more/new UI objects, and the lifecycle of an iOS app.  

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics  
6:50pm - done  

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Here's a link to the [interaction essentials notes](interaction-essentials).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it periodically. 

This week, to help you get started in the course, some sequenced how-to info will be shown below. In class, you will learn some of the reasons behind the info, and have an opportunity to ask questions, and practice using Xcode.

### Friday plan

To start the session, we will briefly cover the leftover topic from Wednesday, [UI object table view](https://dps923.ca/notes/interaction-essentials#ui-object---table-view). 

Then, we discuss a new topic in the [first programming assignment](/graded-work/assign1) - requesting data from a web API. The [topic notes are linked here](webapi-request-intro-sync). 

We will also get a gentle [introduction to debugging](debug-intro). 

Then, your professor will discuss the grading expectations for the programming assignment. 

There will be time available to work on the programming assignment, but probably not enough to complete it.

### Summary

Here's a list of topics that we learned something about this week:
1. Xcode code "re-indent" (select, then Ctrl+I)
