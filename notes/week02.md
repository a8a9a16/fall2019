### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it periodically. 

This week, to help you get started in the course, some sequenced how-to info will be shown below. In class, you will learn some of the reasons behind the info, and have an opportunity to ask questions, and practice using Xcode.

### Friday plan

To start the session, we will briefly cover a few topics related to the first programming assignment. 

Then, your professor will discuss the grading expectations for the programming assignment. 

There will be time available to work on the programming assignment, but probably not enough to complete it.
