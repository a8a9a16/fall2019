## DPS923 MAP523 Week 5 Notes

Last week, we introduced the foundations of a typical substantial iOS app, including the ability to work with multiple scenes, the navigation interface, and using a data model. 

This week, we begin in-depth coverage, and introduce another foundation topic, storage (persistence). 

FYI, a number of new and useful documents have been published in the [Topics](/topics) area of this web site.

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics  
6:50pm - done  

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Tentative plan for this week:
* Storage (persistence) introduction
* Data model design and implementation 
* Substantial app design 
* Table view and cell configuration 
* Interaction pattern - add new item 

Here is information about TBA.

### Friday plan

Come to class prepared to deploy an app to an iOS device, and demonstrate that to the professor. 

Mostly, time to work on the programming assignment, and get help from a classmate or the professor if you need it.
