## Data model storage

In this course, you will learn about on-device *persistent storage* for your app's data model. 

We will cover three kinds of storage:
1. File system, simple files (text, JSON, property list) 
1. Web API 
1. File system, object graph storage, using Core Data 

A typical app can use more than one of these. 

> There are two more kinds of storage, which will likely not be covered in this course, because of time limitations:  
> * iCloud storage, typically synchronized with some kinds of on-device storage  
> * A local database management system, with or without synchronization with a public cloud storage
