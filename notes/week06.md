## DPS923 MAP523 Week 6 Notes

The theme for this week is to get more experience with table views in iOS apps. 

<br>

### Monday plan

(Monday was Thanksgiving day, so there was no class/session.)

<br>

### Wednesday plan

The professor will guide you through the topic hightlights in the textbook. 

Chapter 13: Delegates and Protocols  
Chapter 14: Edit Items  
Chapter 15: Saving and Loading  

<br>

#### Highlights 

The "add item" topic begins on page 253.  
Done with a table view.  
Table view not used as much as standard view.  

Reminder, page 263, that a nav controller is "just" a wrapper around one or more view controllers that all participate in a navigation "chain" or sequence. 

Delegate, have seen that before. Protocol too.  
Delegate is a code module - typically a view controller - that includes methods that handle events that happen in the *delegator*.  
Protocol is a code module - often provided by the framework / library / kit, but could be defined by you, the programmer - that *defines* the method-handling events.  

Page 279 covers delegate content.  

File diff is shown on page 283. Yay.  

The delegate procedure, starts on page 287.  
Sending data back-and-forth, page 308 onwards.  
Refactor / rename, page 314. Nice.  

Saving and loading, starts on page 322.
