## DPS923 MAP523 Week 6 Notes

This week and next, we learn how to use the network. 

<br>

### Wednesday plan

Discussions, and demonstrations.  
Three segments:
5:10pm - topics  
5:40pm - 5-minute break  
5:45pm - topics  
6:15pm - 5-minute break  
6:20pm - topics  
6:50pm - done  

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance. 

Tentative plan for this week:
* Review the past interaction we had with the network
* Learn the new / established way 
* Both one-of and a collection 

Covered in class, and some of the same information about [the new / established way](webapi-interaction-intro) to interact with a web API.

Covered in class, and some of the same information about [sending data to a web API](webapi-interaction-more).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* W06a1FetchIntro 
* W06a2WebApiMore

### Friday plan

A short time, at the beginning of class, to show-and-tell the "add new" pattern. 

Mostly, time to work on the programming assignment, and get help from a classmate or the professor if you need it.
