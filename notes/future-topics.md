## DPS923 MAP523 Future Topics

Various items to consider.

<br>

### General

Good brief description of storyboard from [here on Sep 27 2019](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/):

> A complete iOS app is composed of multiple views through which the user navigates. The relationships between these views are defined by storyboards, which show a complete view of your app’s flow. Interface Builder’s storyboard designer makes it easy to create and design new views, and chain them together to create a complete user interface that’s ready for your custom code.  
> Xcode includes storyboard controllers for:
> * Table View Controller
> * Collection View Controller
> * Navigation Controller
> * Tab Bar Controller
> * Page View Controller
> * GLKit View Controller
> * Or build your own

[if statement](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html#ID127) with "if else" and so on:

You can chain multiple if statements together to consider additional clauses.  
Here, an additional if statement was added to respond to particularly warm temperatures. The final else clause remains, and it prints a response for any temperatures that are neither too warm nor too cold.  
The final else clause is optional, however, and can be excluded if the set of conditions does not need to be complete.
