### Side-by-side views

Scenario:
* image view beside a map view
* equal widths
* constant-size gap between

How to:
1. drag image view, size accordingly 
1. set height to a constant value
1. drag map view, align its top edge to match the image view, size accordingly
1. set height to a constant value
1. set width to use the default gap

Then:
1. select both
1. add new constraints
1. choose Equal Widths, and save, red lines (angry)
1. resolve auto layout issues, in the top Selected Views area, choose Add Missing Constraints
1. it all turns blue
