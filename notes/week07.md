## DPS923 MAP523 Week 7 Notes

The theme for this week is to work with data in iOS apps.

### Modified weekly topic plan

After previewing some of the upcoming topics in the textbook, we will modify the weekly topic plan. 

The following chapters will *NOT* be covered by us in any depth in the next few weeks:
* Chapter 16: Lists  
* Chapter 18: User Defaults
* Chapter 19: UI Improvements
* Chapter 20: Local Notifications  

We may defer them until later in the course, or designate them as *self-study* or as *resources* which can be used later in the course and afterwards.
