## DPS923 MAP523 Week 7 Notes

The theme for this week is to work with data in iOS apps. 

<br>

### Modified weekly topic plan

After previewing some of the upcoming topics in the textbook, we will modify the weekly topic plan, and remove some chapters. 

The following chapters will *NOT* be covered by us in any depth in the next few weeks:
* Chapter 16: Lists  
* Chapter 18: User Defaults
* Chapter 19: UI Improvements
* Chapter 20: Local Notifications  

We may defer them until later in the course, or designate them as *self-study* or as *resources* which can be used later in the course and afterwards.

<br>

### Wednesday plan

The Wednesday class begins with Test 2, and then there will be time to work on the next assignment. 

<br>

#### Test 2

Test 2 is today, at the beginning of the timeslot.

It will cover past content (from the "navigation controllers" Chapter 11 through to "saving and loading" Chapter 15), and new content this week ("improved data model" Chapter 17). 

Review the relevant info about tests on the [week 3 notes page](week03#practice-test) and on the graded work page.

The test will begin at the start of the class timeslot, at 3:20pm, and its duration will be about 40 minutes. It is worth 12%, which means that you will answer any questions worth a total of 12 marks. Most questions are worth one mark, and a few may be worth more.
