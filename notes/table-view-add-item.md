## Table view add item pattern

At this point in time, you have some knowledge of and experience with:
* navigation interface  
* table view  
* data model manager and classes  
* storage  

What if you want to *add new items* to your app? This document covers that topic. 

<br>

### Getting started

New items can be added from a number of different sources:
* a data entry view that you create as part of the app
* a select list with items fetched from the network
* on-devices sources, including the camera

How is this done? Using the *add/edit item* pattern. A central feature of this pattern is the *modal view* concept. You have seen modal views before, when we covered the Alerts and Action Sheets topic. 

In the add (and edit) patterns, a modal view provides self-contained functionality in the context of the current task or workflow. It typically covers the entire screen. Also, it usually displays a button that triggers task completion, and a Cancel button that abandons the task. 

It is new and interesting to us that these "done" and "cancel" tasks are coded in the *hosting* or *presenting* controller, and NOT in the modal view's controller. How? This controller source code file also declares a *protocol* that must be adopted by the host/presenter. 

<br>

#### Design and coding task overview

Here is the design and coding approach:

1. Create a controller for the modal view
2. Add code that declares a *protocol* (with at least one method), and add a *delegate* property to the controller
3. Add a new scene to the storyboard (and embed it in a nav controller)
4. Alternate between the scene and controller code to build the user interface and handle events
5. In the controller, add code (to validate and) package the user input, and call the delegate method
6. In the presenting controller, adopt the protocol, code the segue, and implement the delegate method(s)

A *protocol* is a source code module that declares properties and methods for a task. Then, a class in your app can "adopt" the protocol, and provide an implementation for the protocol's members.

> What is new is that YOU write the protocol code.

(more to come)

From [the docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html)

> A protocol defines ... methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.  
> The protocol can then be *adopted* by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements.  
> Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to *conform* to that protocol.

```swift
protocol ProductAdd: AnyObject {
	// method signatures
}
```

Why does the protocol inherit from `AnyObject`? 

Protocols can be adopted by a class, struct, or enum. 

When we want to limit adoption *only* to classes, we make the protocol inherit from `AnyObject`. 

From [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/class-only-protocols-class-vs-anyobject/11507/12), we learn that `AnyObject` should be used instead of `class`.

From [the docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html#ID270):

> Protocols can require specific ... methods ... to be implemented by conforming types.  
> These methods are written as part of the protocolâ€™s definition in exactly the same way as for normal instance and type methods, but *without curly braces or a method body*.

In the class that adopts the protocol, we write the method body.
