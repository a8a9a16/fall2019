### Developer tools

You *must* use a Mac that runs a recent version of macOS. Any kind, laptop, iMac, or Mac mini. The College has lots of Macs, and the School of ICT has a dedicated Mac lab. 

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (we will use version 9) 

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop (Mac), and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

**Use macOS**

As noted in the [welcome note](welcome), course work is done on a Mac.

If you are not prepared to use a Mac, then drop the course.

**A few thoughts about the required textbook**  

This course has a required textbook. Our pathway through the course will closely track the textbook chapter sequence. Your professor will contribute little or no original conetnt. Don't want to buy the book? You probably won't pass the course. Want to steal the book (i.e. not pay the publisher)? Well, it's your life, morals, and ethics, but keep in mind that the authors are simply asking to be paid for their efforts. Will you ever want to get paid when you graduate and get into the workforce? Yup, you will, so think of this before you steal. Also, think about how often you must buy a textbook for a course - not too often, so this is not a hardship.

### Required online resources

There are several required online resources:

* Apple Developer community - the web site is vast, with thousands of documents. It is a trusted and authoritative source for web developer information.
