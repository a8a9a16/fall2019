## Learning resources

This page has information about and links to learning resources that you will use in this course.

### Developer tools

You *must* use a Mac that runs a recent version of macOS. Any kind, laptop, iMac, or Mac mini. The College has lots of Macs, and the School of ICT has a dedicated Mac lab, room A2534. 

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (we will probably use version 9) 

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop that runs macOS, and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

#### Use macOS

As noted in the [welcome note](welcome), course work is done on a Mac.

If you are not prepared to use a Mac, then *drop the course*.

#### Other Macs on campus

The library (learning commons) has Macs. 

> Your professor will visit the Newnham campus library early in the term, and determine the readiness and suitability of the Macs.
