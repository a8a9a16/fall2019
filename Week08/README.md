### W08a1CDIntro

Based on the `TemplateCDv1` project template. 

It is a two-scene app with a navigation interface.  
Has a list of objects, which can be added to.  
The drill-down workflow scene displays data for the selected item on the list.  

The app uses Core Data technologies.  
Data will survive app unloads and reloads, because it gets persisted to the app's private sandbox file system area.
